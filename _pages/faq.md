## Parking Guidlines

* Each home has ONE reserved spot, which is marked with an R-#or RESERVED (associated to its designated townhouse).  Parking spots are **not** deeded to the unit.
* All visitor (unreserved) spots are first come first serve, and are not linked to any specific homes. This applies to the homeowner as well as visitors.
* All vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks) parked in the cluster must have valid registration/inspection stickers, and valid license plates.
* All vehicles must be in working order.   
* No vehicle (scooter, motorcycle, truck, car) or any other equipment/object can be used to reserve a visitor spot. Any vehicle not being actively used MUST be stored in your reserved spot. The cluster lot cannot be used for long term vehicle storage.  
* If you own a motorcycle or scooter, it MUST be stored in the front of your reserved spot or on your property.    
* On street parking on Soapstone Drive is recommended for guests to our community.  We have a limited number of parking spaces available and they should be available to our residents.
* Households with greater than 3 vehicles must park the extra vehicles on Soapstone Drive so that they are not monopolizing the shared lot.
* Trash and recycling containers should not be placed in the parking lot. This will prevent possible damage to vehicles and trash/recycling bins. This is especially important during the winter season as our snow removal crew will need all the space available to push the snow off of the lot.
