## From the Board



##From the Board##
Thank you to everyone who attended our July Board meeting. The main focus of our discussion was on upcoming capital improvements to our community’s infrastructure. For those who could not attend, the full meeting minutes are available on our website. As everyone is aware we just completed the Concrete Sidewalk Repairs. Sections of our sidewalks were replaced to improve safety and accessibility. Upcoming work is the Asphalt Parking Lot Repaving. The parking lot will be repaved to address wear and tear, potholes, and improve overall appearance on August 11th (Woodhollow and Soft Wind) and August 12th (Hearthstone). We appreciate your patience and cooperation during these projects. Please watch for posted signs and communications regarding temporary parking changes or access restrictions while work is underway.

It wouldn’t be Soapstone News if we didn’t mention trees! 
Reston Association has approved the removal of three trees within our cluster. This work is scheduled for August. 
We hope this will conclude the recent cycle of tree work. If you see any trees that seem to require maintenance let us know!
There are several things we would like to address in this newsletter that we hope people can take action on. The first is our Parking Policy. You can see a summary of our policy in this newsletter but please review it in detail on our website. The Board will start citing cars who are in violation of these policies. Please be neighborly and do not take visitor spots for a long time (for example cars that you don’t drive every day take up visitor spots near homes where people might need them). We hope that residents can follow these rules without us creating stricter parking rules or greater enforcement.

We as the (new) board have tried working on capital improvements in the cluster as well as tree work. However, there are many smaller jobs around the cluster that could really use a volunteer force of residents to tackle some smaller jobs that just seem too small to spend money on a contractor. May we incentivize you with free pizza and drinks to help us one Saturday a month to help with moving mulch, placing rocks to help with run off or fixing a fence? If so, please email us to join the Grounds-keeping Committee!

Finally, a few of our neighbors will be coming around to collect everyone's latest contact information. These will be published to the community with resident's approval.

Parking Policy Reminder

 

As we head into a busy month with construction and community events, please review and abide by our parking policy to ensure fairness and safety for all residents:
Each household is entitled to one reserved parking spot (marked R-#).

Visitor spots are first-come, first-served and not assigned to any home.
Only approved vehicles (passenger vehicles or trucks under 2.5 tons) may park in the lot.
Commercial vehicles, trailers, RVs, boats, and vehicles occupying more than one space are not permitted.
All vehicles must have valid registration, inspection, and license plates, and be in good operating condition.
No vehicle or object may be used to reserve a visitor spot.
Households with more than three vehicles must park extra vehicles on Soapstone Drive.
Do not park in fire lanes or within 15 feet of a hydrant.
Please resolve parking disputes neighbor-to-neighbor when possible.
Violations may result in written notice and, if not corrected, towing at the owner’s expense.
For the full policy, go to our website or contact a Board Member with questions or concerns. Your cooperation helps keep our community safe, fair, and attractive for everyone. Please do not park a car in a visitor spot for long periods of time. Be a nice neighbor!
