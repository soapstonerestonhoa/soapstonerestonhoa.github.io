This is a newsletter page.  You could put all text on this page for every publication date.

You could get fancy with that concept and add a table to help with navigation.  

| Newsletter                  |
|:----------------------------|
| [Spring 2025](#spring-2025) |
| [Fall 2025](#fall-2025)     |
| [Winter 2025](#winter-2025) |

You could also use the same table and link pattern to reference the URL of some external document, instead of linking within this document.

You could get fancier and use the _data/navigation.yml in combintation with the _docs folder to have a separate page for every newsletter entry.  That's what you see on the left side of this page.

The recommended path is whatever option is easiest for you, because the hardest part of this is actually coming up with the content for a newsletter consistently.
