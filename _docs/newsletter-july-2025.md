## From the Board

Dear Soapstone Cluster HOA Members,  

Are you getting this newsletter via email or only the printed version on your door? If you are not getting the emails, please let us know!   

We are happy that we had a successful opening of the new playground at Hearthstone Ct! The playground is now open for all residents and their families to enjoy. Thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate with us. We hope this new space becomes a favorite spot for fun and community gatherings.  

The Board met on June 25th to discuss important neighborhood updates and ongoing projects. You can review the full meeting minutes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/150aUbATtclEOruhWcjXPtM-_x2dfFBnXbxuN0ZzzVHs/edit?usp=drive_link).  

Additionally we will start publishing an agenda for future meetings on our website so residents can join meetings that perhaps include topics of particular interest.   

As part of our ongoing commitment to safety and neighborhood upkeep, several trees have been removed or pruned in accordance with our planned budget. These removals were necessary to address safety concerns and prevent potential property damage. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to maintain a safe and beautiful environment for everyone.  

The Board has obtained quotes for asphalt repaving and sidewalk concrete repairs throughout the cluster. We are in the final stages of selecting a contractor for these projects. More information will be shared soon regarding the timing of the work and how parking will be managed during construction.   

We’re planning a Cluster Picnic social for all residents in August!! This is a great opportunity to meet neighbors, relax, and enjoy our community spaces. More details will be shared soon—keep an eye on your inbox and community boards.  

Thank you for your continued support and engagement. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to the Board.  

Warm regards,  
the HOA Board
