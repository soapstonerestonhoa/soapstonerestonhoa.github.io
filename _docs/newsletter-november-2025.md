## 🍂 From the Board

Fall is the most beautiful time of year in Virginia, and our Cluster is glowing with color as the leaves change!  
The Board has been busy this month working on several community improvements and preparing for exciting initiatives ahead.

Earlier in October, we held another groundskeeping work day to complete the new patio area in lower Hearthstone. This space now provides a cleaner, more stable spot for several residents to place their trash bins — helping reduce mud and runoff in that area.  
A huge thank-you to all the volunteer residents who came out to lend a hand!

The Board is applying for a **Fairfax Tree Rescuers PRISM Grant** to help remove invasive plant species on our common land. If awarded, the grant will fund professional removal of certain vines and shrubs, and the Cluster will match part of the grant through volunteer labor hours.  
The first volunteer workday is scheduled for **Saturday, November 15**, and we encourage everyone — especially high-school students who need community-service hours — to join us.

To update some of our Cluster Standards, we are seeking volunteers to form a committee to help revise our **Design Standards** for submission to Reston Association later this year.  
If you have experience with writing, editing, or design guidelines — or simply want to get involved — please reach out to the Board to volunteer.

As mentioned in last month’s newsletter, the Board has prepared a **draft Standards and Inspection Procedure** outlining how annual home-maintenance inspections will be conducted and how residents will be notified about exterior-upkeep concerns.  
This procedure ensures consistency, fairness, and alignment with Reston Association’s maintenance standards.  
Before the final version is presented for a community vote at the **Annual Meeting in February 2026**, we invite all residents to review the draft Procedure and accompanying **Property Maintenance Checklist (Exhibit A)** and share comments by **December 31, 2025**.

➡️ View the draft documents here:  
[Inspection Procedure and Exhibit A](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tW6loK0IRNV4ILzxJIBdvtOUnRU2OZGl?usp=drive_link)  
or email the Board to request a printed copy.

Finally, for everyone’s safety and comfort, **solar path lights** have been installed around the common-area stairways and sidewalks to improve visibility during darker evenings.

We encourage all residents to join the next Board Meeting on **Wednesday, November 19 @ 7 p.m.** to hear updates on these initiatives and share your thoughts.

**Best regards,**  
*Your Soapstone Cluster HOA Board of Directors*
