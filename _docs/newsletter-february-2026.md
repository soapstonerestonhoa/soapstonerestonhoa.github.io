## From the Board

**What a snowstorm!** It has been a cold and snowy couple of weeks, and this newsletter is a little later than usual. Hopefully everyone is “dug out” by now. In response to the icy conditions, the Board authorized some additional sidewalk plowing to help keep our common areas safe.

Beyond the storm, the Board spent much of the past month finalizing and distributing the Annual Meeting packet. All homeowners should have received it by now—either electronically via email or in hard copy delivered to their door.

The Annual Meeting will be held on **Saturday, February 21, 2026, at 10:00 a.m.**, and resident participation is essential to achieve a quorum. Please take time to review the materials and submit your ballot or proxy if you have not already done so. Voting ensures the proposed FY27 budget can be adopted and allows the community’s business to move forward smoothly. Even if you do not plan to attend the meeting, submitting your vote makes a meaningful difference.

February is also an important month for our Fairfax PRISM grant work. To ensure we meet the required volunteer-hour match, the Board will be hosting a volunteer workday on **Saturday, February 15** (weather permitting), focused on removing invasive plants that threaten our trees and natural areas. Additional details will be shared separately, and we encourage anyone who is able to participate to join us. A second volunteer workday is also planned for March, as February weather can be unpredictable. As the weather warms, we hope to see more residents out enjoying some neighborly company—and yes, we will be giving out stickers!

As a reminder, Soapstone Cluster has transitioned to a new website and new Board email addresses. Our website is now **soapstonecluster.org**, and residents may reach the Board at **[board@soapstonecluster.org](mailto:board@soapstonecluster.org)**, or contact officers directly at **[president@soapstonecluster.org](mailto:president@soapstonecluster.org)**, **[treasurer@soapstonecluster.org](mailto:treasurer@soapstonecluster.org)**, or **[secretary@soapstonecluster.org](mailto:secretary@soapstonecluster.org)**. Please use these email addresses going forward, as they replace our previous Gmail account.

Thank you for your continued involvement and support. We look forward to seeing many of you—either in person or through your submitted votes—at the Annual Meeting and to working together in the weeks ahead.

**Best regards,**
Soapstone Cluster Association
Board of Directors
