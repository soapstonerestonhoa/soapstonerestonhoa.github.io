## From the Board
Dear Soapstone Cluster HOA Members,  
Are you getting this newsletter via email or only the printed version on your door? If you are not getting the emails, please let us know!   
Thank you for those who joined our board meeting in May. We discussed the updates to the different projects and plans going forward. You can see the May BOD meeting minutes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c6OVN8PPEiqe-sfe-DCRdYNXGB0iQnbY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112715785925501502631&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
The two most notable discussions centered around trees and repaving the parking lot. The trees in our cluster are aging and need a lot of maintenance. Thankfully we have enough budget this year to really tackle some of those issues. BrightView (our regular landscape company) had an Arborist review all the trees and we agreed to remove several trees as well as prune many that would potentially be a hazard. We have had a tree fall again in May so this is very timely. 
Our other large project is going to be repaving the parking lot as well as changing some of the sidewalk concrete. The parking lot has not been repaved in over 20 years and our reserve study recommends to repave it every 20 years. We have collected quotes from three vendors and will discuss our final decision and execution plan at the next board meeting.  
Finally, the playground on Hearthstone is finally getting finished. With the rain and the holiday weekend it just wasn't our luck, however, we are happy it will be ready soon! Join us on Sunday, June 8th at 11 am  in celebrating the opening of the new playground and come out to meet your neighbors!   
Overall, May has been a busy month but we are excited about a lot of the upgrades we will be doing to make our neighborhood safer and more beautiful!  
Warm regards,  
The HOA Board
