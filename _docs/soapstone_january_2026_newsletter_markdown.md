## ❄️ From the Board ❄️

As we welcome the new year, the Board would like to wish all residents a very Happy New Year and reflect on the past year. This was the first year for the current Board, and it was both busy and productive as we learned how our HOA operates while making meaningful progress across the cluster.

Over the past year, we repaved the parking lot and completed concrete sidewalk repairs, improving both safety and accessibility. We added a small patio area to provide a better solution for residents who previously lacked an appropriate place to set out garbage cans, installed solar lighting along stairways to improve visibility and safety, and introduced a monthly newsletter to improve communication and outreach.

In January, the Board will not hold a Board meeting as we prepare for the Annual Meeting on Saturday, February 21, 2026, at 10 a.m. Please look out for the Annual Meeting packet, which will be distributed later in January.

At the December Board meeting, we presented a draft FY27 budget and received helpful feedback from residents. Since then, the Board has reviewed comments and incorporated input where appropriate, and we believe the proposed budget provides a thoughtful and balanced path forward for the cluster.

Looking ahead to 2026, planned activities include additional volunteer workdays for invasive plant removal, painting stairways for safety, and removing bamboo behind homes where needed. The Board will also be soliciting competitive bids for landscaping services ahead of the April 1, 2026 contract renewal as we evaluate service quality, resident feedback, and overall cost. Finally, based on the cluster’s reserve analysis, no large capital projects are planned for 2026 or 2027, though smaller maintenance projects may be undertaken as needed to address safety or upkeep.

Thank you for your continued involvement and support. We look forward to working together in the year ahead.
