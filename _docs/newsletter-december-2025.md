## \ud83c\udf42 From the Board
Fall is the most beautiful time of year in Virginia, and our Cluster is glowing with color as the leaves change! The Board has been busy this month working on several community improvements and preparing for exciting initiatives ahead.

Earlier in October, we held another groundbreaking work day to complete the new patio area in lower Hearthstone. This space now provides a clean, secure area for several residents to place their trash bins – helping reduce clutter and runoff in that area.

A huge thank–you to all the volunteer residents who came out to lend a hand!

The Board is applying for a **Fairfax Tree Rescuers PRISM Grant** to help remove invasive plant species on our common land. If awarded, the grant will reimburse the removal of certain vines and shrubs, and the Cluster will match part of the grant through volunteer labor hours.

Our cluster-wide volunteer workday is scheduled for **Saturday, November 15**, and we encourage everyone — especially high-school students who need community-service hours — to join us.
