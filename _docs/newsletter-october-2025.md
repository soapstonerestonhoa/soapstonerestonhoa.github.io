## 🍂 From the Board  

The crisp air and colorful leaves are finally here! There's so much to look forward to this season, and we on the Board are especially excited about Halloween and all the festivities coming up.  

Your Board of Directors met in September to discuss several important community matters. If you'd like the full details, the official meeting minutes are now available on the [Soapstone Cluster website](https://soapstonerestonhoa.github.io/handbook/governance/).  

A few key initiatives the Board is currently focusing on include:
- Investigating improved lighting in specific areas of the cluster  
- Planning to paint the stairs to enhance visibility and safety  
- Exploring strategies to better manage and address recurring parking violations along yellow curbs  

This month we also had a productive meeting with the **Reston Association (RA)**, which resulted in two key action items:  
1. The Board will be reviewing and updating our **Cluster Design Standards**, specifically to add approved colors for decks and fences.  
   → Residents are encouraged to review the current [Design Standards](https://soapstonerestonhoa.github.io/handbook/governance/) and send any ideas or suggestions to **scaboard20191@gmail.com**.  
2. The Board is developing a clear process to ensure compliance with Reston covenants regarding the maintenance of homes and yards. This will eventually require a community vote at the annual meeting to formalize the process.  

We encourage everyone to attend the next Board Meeting for a full discussion on the covenant-compliance process and other community updates.  

We can’t wait to see all the spooky Halloween decorations and costumes! 🎃  
Please remember, if you do not wish to receive trick-or-treaters, simply turn off your porch light on Halloween night.  

Finally, join your neighbors for a fun, outdoor **Halloween Movie Night** — details below. Bring your own chair and popcorn!  

**Best regards,**  
*Your Soapstone Cluster HOA Board of Directors*

## 🚛 Weekly Trash & Recycling Reminder  

Trash and recycling collection occurs every **Thursday**.  
Please place all trash (bagged or in reusable containers) and recycling at the curb **the night before collection**.  

Placing items out earlier is prohibited as it attracts animals and creates unsanitary conditions.  
For recycling, items must be placed in paper bags or reusable containers — do **not** use plastic bags.  

Review American Disposal’s policies [here](https://tinyurl.com/SCH0A).
