**From the Board**  
The crisp air and colorful leaves are finally here! There's so much to look forward to this season, and we on the board are especially excited about Halloween and all the festivities coming up. Your Board of Directors met in September to discuss several important community matters. If you'd like the full details, the official meeting minutes are now accessible on the Soapstone Cluster website https://soapstonerestonhoa.github.io/handbook/governance/. 
A few key initiatives the board is currently focusing on include investigating adding improved lighting in specific areas of the cluster and planning to paint the stairs to enhance visibility and safety. We are also looking into different strategies to better manage and address recurring parking violations along the yellow curbs. 
This month we also had a productive meeting with the Reston Association (RA), which resulted in two key action items. First, we will be reviewing and updating our Cluster Design Standards, specifically to add approved colors for decks and fences. We strongly encourage all residents to review the current Design Standards (available on the website) and send any ideas or suggestions for updates to the board email address. Second, the board is developing a clear process to ensure compliance with Reston covenants regarding the maintenance of homes and yards. We will present ideas on how to implement this process at our next board meeting. Once this process is finalized, the cluster members will have to vote in the annual meeting to execute a resolution to the bylaws to formalize the procedure. We encourage everyone to attend the next board meeting for a full discussion on the covenant compliance process and other community updates. 
We can't wait to see all the spooky Halloween decorations and costumes! Please remember, if you do not wish to receive trick-or-treaters, simply turn off your front porch light on Halloween night. Finally, come join your neighbors for a fun, outdoor Halloween movie watching event. We'll be setting up in the front part of Hearthstone (details are included here). Bring your own chair and popcorn! We look forward to a fantastic fall season with all of you!
Best regards,  Your Soapstone Cluster HOA Board of Directors

**Weekly Trash & Recycling Reminder**  
Trash and recycling collection occurs every Thursday. Please place all trash (bagged or in reusable containers) and recycling on the curb of the parking lot the night before collection. Placing items out earlier is prohibited as it attracts animals and creates unsanitary conditions. Storage of exposed refuse or debris is prohibited, except for this temporary placement awaiting pickup. For recycling, items must be placed in paper bags or reusable containers; do NOT use plastic bags for recycling products. Please review American Disposal’s policies here: https://tinyurl.com/SCH0A
