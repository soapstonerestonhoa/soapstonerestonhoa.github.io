**From the Board**  
As the busy days of summer give way to the cooler air of early fall, we hope everyone is enjoying the change in seasons and that the new school year is off to a great start.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! The concrete sidewalk and parking lot asphalt replacement projects were a great success, and we couldn’t have done it without your support. We want to extend a huge thank you for your patience and cooperation during a particularly busy summer of community projects. We understand these kinds of projects can be disruptive, and we appreciate your flexibility as we worked to complete them efficiently. We anticipate no large disruptive projects in the near future.  

We are thrilled to announce a significant achievement in our community's waste management services. The board has successfully negotiated a new contract with American Disposal, which not only avoids an anticipated 10% rate increase but also reduces our monthly bill below the current rate. This accomplishment reflects our commitment to securing the best possible financial outcomes for our community. In addition to lowering our monthly bill, we have negotiated a more favorable annual increase and a higher fuel surcharge threshold. These improvements are steps toward maintaining stable dues for the next fiscal year, providing tangible financial benefits for all residents. Also, if your current American Disposal bins are damaged, you can request replacements. Please note that American Disposal charges for new bins unless your current American Disposal bin is non-functional.  

A big thank you to the residents who have volunteered for the new Grounds and Maintenance Committee. The committee's first workday will be on Saturday, September 20th. The Board has appointed Adam Smith as the Director of the Committee, and residents who signed up should have received an introductory email. There are several projects to work on in the cluster. Even if you didn’t sign up to be on the Committee, we will advertise work days for residents to join if they can help out. More 'hands on deck' would be greatly appreciated for some quick tasks. We will send out more details on the workday soon.  

After a brief break in August to focus on community capital improvement projects, the Board will resume our regular monthly meetings with a board meeting on Wednesday, September 17th, at 7:00 pm. We look forward to seeing you there!  
Before we sign off, just a reminder that a group will be coming around soon to update everyone's contact information. This information will be used to create an updated directory for cluster residents.  

Thank you for your continued support and involvement in our community!  

Best regards,  

**Your Soapstone Cluster HOA Board of Directors**
