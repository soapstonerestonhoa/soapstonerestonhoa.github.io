## From the Board  
<small>Dear Soapstone Cluster HOA Members,<small>

<small>Spring has arrived, bringing warmth and exciting developments to our community. We are thrilled about the upcoming opening of Cafe DeClieu near our cluster, anticipated for May 6th.<small>

<small>We've been diligently familiarizing ourselves with the SCA board operations and meeting with various vendors to assess our current standing.<small>

<small>Despite technical difficulties, our first board meeting on April 16th provided valuable updates on last month's activities. You can review the meeting minutes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rQ9ToDfrzOQHw_eH-nnpeS_NYOBGD5q/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112715785925501502631&rtpof=true&sd=true&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9FkEMRWHBwimFSA2fmBd8mU2LLXe_W8oCKjcgG32wZBVMDaocsJMvImA6XG17k0iEv_JO4).<small>

<small>A fallen tree from RA property caused damage to cluster and homeowner properties, including a retaining wall. Thankfully, no one was hurt. We are working with vendors and insurance to manage repairs without tapping into our capital reserves.<small>

<small>Our revamped Cluster website is your go-to resource for information, including quick links to essential contacts and documents. We welcome your feedback! Monthly newsletters, board meeting minutes, and financial reports from GHA will be posted for your review.<small>

<small>Join us at the next meeting to discuss our upcoming capital project priorities, such as the parking lot. Your ideas are welcome!<small>

<small>Warm regards,<small>  
<small>The HOA Board<small>

<small>Reminder that this spring you can help the environment by planting native plants.
